The tesseract package provides R bindings [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract):
a powerful optical character recognition (OCR) engine that supports over 100
languages. The engine is highly configurable in order to tune the detection
algorithms and obtain the best possible results.

Keep in mind that OCR (pattern recognition in general) is a very difficult
problem for computers. Results will rarely be perfect and the accuracy rapidly
decreases with the quality of the input image. But if you can get your input
images to reasonable quality, Tesseract can often help to extract most of the
text from the image.

## Extract Text from Images

OCR is the process of finding and recognizing text inside images, for example
from a screenshot, scanned paper. The image below has some example text:

![Image with eight lines of English text](../man/figures/wilde.png)

The `ocr()` function extracts text from an image file. After indicating the
engine for the language, it will return the text found in the image:

```{r}
library(cpp11tesseract)
file <- system.file("examples", "wilde.png", package = "cpp11tesseract")
eng <- tesseract("eng")
text <- ocr(file, engine = eng)
cat(text)
```

The `ocr_data()` function returns all words in the image along with a bounding
box and confidence rate.

```{r}
results <- ocr_data(file, engine = eng)
results
```

## Language Data

The tesseract OCR engine uses language-specific training data in the recognize
words. The OCR algorithms bias towards words and sentences that frequently
appear together in a given language, just like the human brain does. Therefore
the most accurate results will be obtained when using training data in the
correct language. 

Use `tesseract_info()` to list the languages that you currently have installed.

```{r}
tesseract_info()
```

By default the R package only includes English training data. Windows and Mac
users can install additional training data using `tesseract_download()`. Let's
OCR a screenshot from Wikipedia in Simplified Chinese.

![Image with thirteen lines of Chinese text](../man/figures/chinese.jpg)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Only need to do download once:
tesseract_download("chi_sim")
```

```{r eval = has_chi_sim}
# Now load the dictionary
(simplified_chinese <- tesseract("chi_sim"))
file <- system.file("examples", "chinese.jpg", package = "cpp11tesseract")
text <- ocr(file, engine = simplified_chinese)
cat(text)
```

Compare with the copy and paste from the Wikipedia.

```{r}
text2 <- readLines(
  system.file("examples", "chinese.txt", package = "cpp11tesseract")
)

cat(text2)
```

## Read from PDF files

If your images are stored in PDF files they first need to be converted to a
proper image format. We can do this in R using the `pdf_convert` function from
the `cpp11poppler` package. Use a high DPI to keep quality of the image.

```r
library(cpp11poppler)
file <- system.file("examples", "bondargentina.pdf", package = "cpp11tesseract")
pngfile <- pdf_convert(file, dpi = 600)
text <- ocr(pngfile)
cat(text)
```

```r
> cat(text)

## Read from TIFF files

If your images are stored in PDF files they first need to be converted to a
proper image format. We can do this in R using the `pdf_convert` function from
the `cpp11poppler` package. Use a high DPI to keep quality of the image.

```{r}
file <- system.file("examples", "bondargentina.tiff", package = "cpp11tesseract")
text <- ocr(file)
cat(text)
```

## Tesseract Control Parameters

Tesseract supports hundreds of "control parameters" which alter the OCR engine
 Use `tesseract_params()` to list all parameters with their default value and a
 brief description. It also has a handy `filter` argument to quickly find
 parameters that match a particular string.

```{r}
# List all parameters with *colour* in name or description
tesseract_params("colour")
```

Do note that some of the control parameters have changed between Tesseract
engine 3 and 4.

```{r}
tesseract_info()["version"]
```

### Whitelist / Blacklist characters

One powerful parameter is `tessedit_char_whitelist` which restricts the output
to a limited set of characters. This may be useful for reading for example
numbers such as a bank account, zip code, or gas meter.

The whitelist parameter works for all versions of Tesseract engine 3 and also
engine versions 4.1 and higher, but unfortunately it did not work in Tesseract
4.0.

![A receipt in English with food and toys for Mr. Duke](../man/figures/receipt.jpg)

```{r}
file <- system.file("examples", "receipt.jpg", package = "cpp11tesseract")
numbers <- tesseract(options = list(tessedit_char_whitelist = "-$.0123456789"))
cat(ocr(file, engine = numbers))
```

To test if this actually works, look at the output without the whitelist:

```{r}
cat(ocr(file, engine = eng))
```

As an Easter egg, this is Mr. Duke:

![Mr. Duke, a dog of the Australian Sheppard kind](../man/figures/mrduke.jpg)

Here is the extracted text:

```{r}
file <- system.file("examples", "mrduke.jpg", package = "cpp11tesseract")
text <- ocr(file, engine = eng)
cat(text)
```

## Best versus Fast models

In order to improve the OCR results, Tesseract has two variants of models that
can be used. The `tesseract_download()` can download the 'best' (but slower)
model, which increases the accuracy. The 'fast' (but less accurate) model is the
default.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
file <- system.file("examples", "chinese.jpg", package = "cpp11tesseract")

# download the best model (vertical script download is to avoid a warning)
dir <- tempdir()
tesseract_download("chi_sim_vert", datapath = dir, model = "best")
tesseract_download("chi_sim", datapath = dir, model = "best")

# compare the results: fast (text1) vs best (text2)
text1 <- ocr(file, engine = tesseract("chi_sim"))
text2 <- ocr(file, engine = tesseract("chi_sim", datapath = dir))

cat(text1)
cat(text2)
```

## Contributed models

The `tesseract_contributed_download()` function can download contributed models.
For example, the `grc_hist` model is useful for Polytonic Greek. Here is an
example from Sophocles' Ajax (source: [Ajax Multi-Commentary](https://github.com/AjaxMultiCommentary))

![polytonicgreek](../man/figures/polytonicgreek.png)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
file <- system.file("examples", "polytonicgreek.png", package = "cpp11tesseract")

# download the best models
dir <- tempdir()
tesseract_download("grc", datapath = dir, model = "best")
tesseract_contributed_download("grc_hist", datapath = dir, model = "best")

# compare the results: grc (text1) vs grc_hist (text2)
text1 <- ocr(file, engine = tesseract("grc", datapath = dir))
text2 <- ocr(file, engine = tesseract("grc_hist", datapath = dir))

cat(text1)
cat(text2)
```

## Comparison with Amazon Textract

*Note: Amazon and Textract are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc.*

Textract [documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-r-with-amazon-web-services-for-document-analysis/) uses page three of the [January 1966 report](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/surveys-and-data/greenbook-data/greensheets/greensheets-1966.zip?la=en&hash=8B8ABA92C3F0B2939328D47B6230F3A3) from Philadelphia Fed's [Tealbook](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/philadelphia-data-set) (formerly Greenbook).

![tealbook](../man/figures/tealbook.png)

Here is the first element of the list returned by Textract:

```r
# List of 13
# $ BlockType      : chr "TABLE"
# $ Confidence     : num 100
# $ Text           : chr(0)
# $ RowIndex       : int(0)
# $ ColumnIndex    : int(0)
# $ RowSpan        : int(0)
# $ ColumnSpan     : int(0)
# $ Geometry       :List of 2
# .. <not shown>
# $ Id             : chr "c6841638-d3e0-414b-af12-b94ed34aac8a"
# $ Relationships  :List of 1
# ..$ :List of 2
# .. ..$ Type: chr "CHILD"
# .. ..$ Ids : chr [1:256] "e1866e80-0ef0-4bdd-a6fd-9508bb833c03" ...
# $ EntityTypes    : list()
# $ SelectionStatus: chr(0)
# $ Page           : int 3
```

Here is Tesseract's output:

```{r}
file <- system.file("examples", "tealbook.png", package = "cpp11tesseract")
text <- ocr(file)

cat(text)
```

One way to organize the output is to split the text before the first digit on
each line.

```{r}
text <- strsplit(text, "\n")[[1]]
text <- text[6:length(text)]

for (i in seq_along(text)) {
  firstdigit <- regexpr("[0-9]", text[i])[1]

  variable <- trimws(substr(text[i], 1, firstdigit - 1))

  values <- strsplit(substr(text[i], firstdigit, nchar(text[i])), " ")[[1]]
  values <- trimws(gsub(",", ".", values))
  values <- suppressWarnings(as.numeric(gsub("\\.$", "", values)))

  if (length(values[!is.na(values)]) < 1) {
    next
  }

  res <- c(variable, values)

  names(res) <- c(
    "variable", "y1964", "y1965est", "y1965q1",
    "y1965q2", "y1965q3", "y1965q4est", "y1966q1pro"
  )

  if (i == 1) {
    df <- as.data.frame(t(res))
  } else {
    df <- rbind(df, as.data.frame(t(res)))
  }
}

head(df)
```

The result is not perfect (e.g. I still need to change "Gross National Product
in Constant" to add the "(1958) Dollars"), but neither is Textract's and it
requires to write a more complex loop to organize the data. Certainly, this can
be simplified by using the Tidyverse.
